# KTH-DD2424-Assignment3

This repo is the code for the assignment 3 for course DD2424(Deep Learning in Data Science) in KTH. We are supposed to train and test *k*-layer networks with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. As the assignment 1 and 2 ask us to train and test 1-layer and 2-layer network seperately, I only push code for assignment 3.

The *k*-layer networks are all fully connected layer, with ReLu or sigmoid activation function and batch normalization.
